## Overview
The **AI Playground** is intended for learning and experimenting with OpenCV's core features, covering tasks like color-based segmentation, object detection, and image transformation.  
Itâ€™s ideal for beginners exploring computer vision concepts.

## Mini Projects

### **1. Color Detection**
**What?**  
This project detects specific colors in an image using HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space. A set of trackbars allows real-time adjustment of the HSV range, making it easier to isolate and analyze desired colors.  

**Where?**  
This project can be applied to various real world problems, such as fruit ripeness in Agriculture sector, traffic light recognition in Smart City, or skin color changes monitoring in Healthcare sector.  

**Features:**
- Real-time HSV range adjustment using trackbars
- Color masking with `cv2.inRange()`
- Display of original image, HSV view, and masked output

**How It Works?**
1. Load the image and convert it to HSV.
2. Get HSV min/max values from trackbars.
3. Apply color filtering to create a mask.
4. Display the original image, HSV result, and mask.
